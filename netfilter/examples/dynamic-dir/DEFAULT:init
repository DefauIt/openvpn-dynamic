# Note that this is an EXAMPLE only to demonstrate usage and how it connects to

# The DEFAULT:init file is loaded on openvpn initilization through the
# up-script. In this case, the vpn_fw chain (which must already exist in the
# loaded OS ruleset) is flushed, clearing out any stale rules from a previous
# VPN server instance.
#
# Additional processing or rule manipulation could occur here as well. Note that
# this rule file is loaded through iptables-restore -n, where -n does not flush
# the tables before loading the rules.
