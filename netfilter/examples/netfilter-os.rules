# This is intended as an EXAMPLE only -- you need to integrate a solution into
# your own ruleset.
#
# The important bits to note here as it relates to the rest of the files in the
# examples/ directory include the vpn_fw chain, which gets flushed on openvpn
# startup, and the default-accept policy that is outside this chain.
#
# This isn't a very complex example, but it should demonstrate how the rule
# files are loaded and the intent when adding per-client rules, and the function
# of the DEFAULT:init rules. Note that the dynamic rulesets are loaded via
# iptables-restore -n, where -n doesn't flush the existing rules on load.
